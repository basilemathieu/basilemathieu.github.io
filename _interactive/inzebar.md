OctoTrash is a VR experience that aims to increase awareness around the issues of waste pollution in our oceans and seas. To create a positive impact and immersive experience, OctoTrash enables the user to play the game through the eyes of an octopus living on the bottom of the ocean. The aim is to collect as much trash as possible before it piles up too high or ends up hurting other marine life! Alike a VR arcade game or endless runner but staying still and holding your ground, you have to do your best to survive the ever growing waves of trash. Feedback from various people that played the game showed that OctoTrash carries a strong message and would be impactful as well as fun for different audiences.
