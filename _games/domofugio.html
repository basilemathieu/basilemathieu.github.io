My very first Unity project. For a narrative writing exercice we made a game/interactive app about automation systems and remote surveillance. It tells the story 
of a woman using an app, Domofugio, to check on her children at home remotely. When an intruder breaks in her house while her kids are there, she is left only 
with the remote home automation system and an outsider's view of what's happening. You can download it and play it <a href="https://adls.itch.io/domofugio">HERE</a>
(it's only available in French, sorry).

Interaction is minimal to put the player in a helpless position and give the piece a dystopian, disturbing feeling.
