A student project created during a game jam at Les Gobelins. The subject being "cult movies", we chose Suspiria (Dario Argento, 1977) for its atmosphere and lighting. 
We tried to reproduce the claustrophobic, disorienting experience of the movie's heroine. You can download and play it <a href="https://adls.itch.io/suspirium">HERE</a>.
<br><br>
Our main influence was the original Alone In The Dark, with its awkard and unsettling camera angles. The abilities gained while playing through the game are 
inspired by technics used in Dario Argento's films : camera travelling, sudden light changes and moving decor.
