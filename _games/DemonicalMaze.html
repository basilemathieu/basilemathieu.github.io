This is a map I designed with GZDoom Builder for a level design workshop you can download <a href="https://adls.itch.io/domofugio">HERE</a> and play it in GZDoom (experience is better)

<br><br>
It's all about finding you way in this maze made with dimensional hubs of wich you can understand the principles by observing and trying.
